My favorite movie is Pixar's "The Incredibles" for being one of those movies that I would watch all the time as a kid. Looking back, as I got older, I always picked up on some of the more sutble details that slipped past me, and made re-watching it all the more interesting. Could even say that the sequel is right up there in my Top 10, if not tied with the original.

My least favorite movie would have to be the "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within", for being one of those licensed movies that really didn't fit the series it's based off of. The CGI felt a bit off and the whole story's idea of "the enviornment fighting back against human expansion" with alien ghosts and frankly out of context horror scenes just didn't sit well for me. There were a few redeeming qualities, but I'd really need to stretch things. It just irks me a little as a whole. If it didn't have that "Final Fantasy" label, or if it embraced a few of the series' details and even jokes, it would have been fine.
